	<summary><![CDATA[Perpetually miserable<br><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Hi there. Welcome to my profile.<br>Name's Likai. I'm a folf.<br><br>I'm a lonely person who always seeks true companionship - true belonging - wherever it may be. I tend to be very sensitive,  and I typically keep to myself. I have an odd mentality and I may be a bit selfish in nature, though I really try not to be. Friends mean a lot to me, and they keep me sane as I continue on my journey to understanding both myself and my endgame in this world we in live in.<br><br>I am usually rather passive but certain things can really get me in a gloomy mood.<br><br>I will gladly meet your acquiantance, and I will take your hand in friendship and treat you as family; however, I have no business in being lured into such a friendship if I end up being entirely ignored, forgotten or deserted. Of all things, this is what tears me apart inside, the most.<br><br>I really like it when people go out of their way to start a conversation with me, rather than the other way around. It makes me feel pretty good.<br><br>Now, I don't quite fancy revealing everything about myself here, as if I as a person could be defined in a mere block of text. I think there's a story much deeper of people that can't truly be experienced from a simple glance at a profile. If you truly care enough; why not meet me and discover who I really am, firsthand?<br><br>You may just be surprised.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Vote for me for next Governor of New York!~<br><br><br>I am a founder of GameFurs, working proudly beside JonnyBoy0719. Check out our site at www.gamefurs.net<br><br>Also have over 2 million viewers on my Youtube. Name's thunderbolt31197<br><br>And I'm additionally a l33t clarinet player.<br><br>_______________/__l /_l<br>_____________/____v__l<br>____________/________l<br>___________/_/________\<br>___________V_________\<br>___________/_________\<br>__________/___________\<br>_________/____________\<br>_________/____________\<br>________/____________/<br>_______/______l____l_l<br>______/_______\____\l_<br>_____/____---- __\____l<br>____/__/______\_\ ___i<br>____l__/_______)_\___l<br>___/___________/_\___\<br>__/\__________/___\___\<br>_l _____ _______)__\ ___)<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://www.gamefurs.net" target="_blank"  onclick="return AlertNonSteamSite( this );">GameFurs</a><br><a class="bb_link" href="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/dRd_vZT6zPY" target="_blank"  onclick="return AlertNonSteamSite( this );">Life in a Nutshell</a>]]></summary>
