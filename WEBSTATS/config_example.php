Population CSV file. This is taken from the United States Census Bureau, you

http://www.census.gov/popest/datasets.html

The file will be about half way down, under "Metropolitan, micropolitan, and
combined statistical area datasets", the CSV file under "Combined
statistical area population and estimated components of change". Or, check
the release thread and I can provide an exact URL for the download.

Keep in mind that the file has been drastically altered from it's original
state, including adding individual States as well as the entire US. If you
want to create your own CSV file, message me on Allied Modders and I will
help and possibly include it in a next release.
